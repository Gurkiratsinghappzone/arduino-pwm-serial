Open the below link for circuit diagram
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HAKdRBAGkTb3drTQaSxpNjdKRLKJ6PPB/view?usp=drivesdk
after making the circuit, now you have to upload the code which is present in code file 
Here is the direct link to code: https://github.com/Gurkiratsinghappzone/arduino-pwm-serial/blob/7840752ef0ba0378ffd20cca9d5dd2e7b561b92f/Code
 * after uploading , open the serial monitor and write 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0
 * enter only one number at a time
 * that's it
